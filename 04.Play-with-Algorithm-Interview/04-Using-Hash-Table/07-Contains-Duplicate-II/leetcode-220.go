// Based on Buckets
// each time, all we need to check is the bucket that x belongs to and its two adjacent buckets
//
// One thing worth mentioning is the difference from bucket sort â€“
// Each of our buckets contains at most one element at any time,
// because two elements in a bucket means "almost duplicate" and we can return early from the function.
// Therefore, a HashMap with an element associated with a bucket label is enough for our purpose.
//
// Time Complexity: O(n)
// Space Complexity: O(k)
